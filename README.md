## Overview of the School District Analysis
Maria is in charge of schools' student success in her district. She oversees how the students are doing and how the school system is helping the students succeed in their classes. Many district officials analyze and interpret the data given to improve the school financially or educationally. For this challenge, Maria looked over students' math and reading scores. During this process, she come across Thomas High School students and sees tempering of grades of ninth grade students. With the honesty and high integrity of the district, Maria will analyze the school's data by nullifying the ninth grade students' math and reading score. By taking these actions, she will be able to find the true trends on school performance and declare the necessary changes for Thomas High School.
