## Overview of the School District Analysis
Maria is in charge of schools' student success in her district. She oversees how the students are doing and how the school system is helping the students succeed in their classes. Many district officials analyze and interpret the data given to improve the school financially or educationally. For this challenge, Maria looked over students' math and reading scores. During this process, she come across Thomas High School students and sees tempering of grades of ninth grade students. With the honesty and high integrity of the district, Maria will analyze the school's data by nullifying the ninth grade students' math and reading score. By taking these actions, she will be able to find the true trends on school performance and declare the necessary changes for Thomas High School.

## Summary
In the end, Maria came to a conclusion that the nullified grade made a big dent to Thomas High School's ranking and the reputation for the school and its management system. There are four changes in the updated school district analysis that resulted through the nullification of ninth-grade students' math and reading grades.
1. The biggest changes that Maria could find that charter schools perform better than district schools. When the data for scores by school type, charter schools have higher overall passing scores and testing scores.
2. School size also have a hugh impact on test scores. If one school is bigger than the other, it has larger pool of student population and would decrease the test score and overall passing rate depending on the school funding and district/charter.
3. Through the NaN method of eliminating academic dishonesty of Thomas High School, Maria can see that there is a big change between the initial analys and final analysis, which final analysis portrayed the true data for the district schools.
4. Despite all three changes that are true, school spending did not particularly affect the math and reading scores.
